# Chaos Theory in Biosignals for Glucose Monitoring

## Overview
This project applies chaos theory to analyze biosignals for non-invasive blood glucose monitoring. It focuses on using electrocardiographic (ECG) and photoplethysmography (PPG) signals with an ESP32 microcontroller and MAX30105 sensor.

## Key Features
- ECG and PPG signal acquisition using ESP32.
- Analysis of biosignals using chaos theory principles.
- Non-invasive approach for monitoring blood glucose levels.

## Hardware Requirements
- ESP32 microcontroller.
- MAX30105 sensor for PPG signal acquisition.

## Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE for ESP32 programming.
- Python for data analysis and visualization.

## Setup and Installation
1. Assemble the hardware setup with ESP32 and MAX30105.
2. Upload the Arduino sketch to ESP32 for ECG and PPG data acquisition.
3. Use the provided Python scripts for data analysis and visualization.

## Data Collection
- Data is collected from ECG and PPG sensors and stored for analysis.
- The system provides real-time data collection and storage capabilities.

## Analysis Techniques
- The project uses techniques such as mutual information calculation, embedding dimension estimation, and phase space reconstruction.
- Python scripts are provided for each analytical technique, along with detailed comments.
